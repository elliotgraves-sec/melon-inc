    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        At Melon, our mission is to provide cutting-edge security solutions while fostering a transparent and collaborative environment. We specialize in DevSecOps, ensuring that security is integrated throughout the development lifecycle to mitigate risks and safeguard our clients' data.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of our key team members, <strong>Elliot Graves</strong>, was a former security engineer who played a pivotal role in some of our most critical security initiatives. Elliot's work, particularly his commitment to uncovering hidden threats, was invaluable. However, Elliot's departure was shrouded in mystery, and rumors began to circulate about a discovery he had made just before leaving the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elliot always advocated for proactive transparency, believing that knowledge should be shared for the greater good. Despite leaving the company, we believe some of his findings may still be relevant today. For those interested, we encourage you to look into Elliot's past workâ€”it could reveal something others might have overlooked. You can find his GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/elliotgraves-sec" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>
        Our DevSecOps team is a group of highly skilled professionals committed to safeguarding the integrity of our client's systems. While we can't always disclose our full team roster, some of our key members include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sarah Mitchell</strong> - Head of Security Operations</li>
        <li><strong>James Ford</strong> - Senior DevSecOps Engineer</li>
        <li><strong>Amanda Lee</strong> - Security Analyst</li>
        <li><strong>Elliot Graves</strong> - Former Security Engineer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Despite Elliot's departure, his influence on our team and the security culture at Melon remains strong. His work has shaped much of our current security approach, and we continue to reflect on his legacy.
