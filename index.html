    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        At Melon, we strive to provide innovative security solutions with a focus on transparency and collaboration. Our expertise lies in DevSecOps, ensuring that security is integrated seamlessly into the development process to mitigate risks and safeguard our clients' data.
    </p>
    <p>
        A key figure in our journey was <strong>Elliot Graves</strong>, a former security engineer who played a critical role in some of our most important security initiatives. His attention to detail and commitment to uncovering hidden vulnerabilities was unmatched. However, Elliot's departure was shrouded in mystery, sparking rumors about a discovery he made just before he left the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elliot was an advocate for transparency and always believed that the truth should come to light. Though no longer part of the team, some of his findings remain relevant. We invite you to explore his past work, as it may reveal something others overlooked. You can find his GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/elliotgraves-sec" target="_blank">here</a>.
